# Portfolio-1
This is a portfolio project that showcases my past work and also shows off skills I learned in my first week of coding bootcamp. In this project I utilized HTML and CSS to create a simple portfolio with animations and dynamic flex boxes that change with screen size. The nav bar scrolls you down to each respective section. All of the boxes link to different projects or placeholder links and move with animations when hovered.
